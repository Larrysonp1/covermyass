# Introduction

Covermyass is a post-exploitation tool to cover your tracks on various operating systems. It was designed for penetration testing "covering tracks" phase, before exiting the compromised server. At any time, you can run the tool to find which log files exists on the system, then run again later to erase those files. The tool will tell you which file can be erased with the current user permissions. Files are overwritten repeatedly with random data, in order to make it harder for even very expensive hardware probing to recover the data.

It supports the three major operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows) and a few smaller ones (FreeBSD, OpenBSD).

### Current status ###

This tool is still in beta. Upcoming versions might bring breaking changes. For now, we're focusing Linux and Darwin support, Windows may come later.

### Installation ###

Download the latest release : 

```bash
curl -sSL https://github.com/sundowndev/covermyass/releases/latest/download/covermyass_linux_amd64 -o ./covermyass
```

```bash
chmod +x ./covermyass
```

### Verify digital signatures ###

covermyass releases are signed using PGP key (rsa4096) with ID `E5BC23488DA8C7AC` and fingerprint `1A662C679AD91F549A77CD96E5BC23488DA8C7AC`. Our key can be retrieved from common keyservers.

1. Download binary, checksums and signature
```bash
curl -L https://github.com/sundowndev/covermyass/releases/latest/download/covermyass_linux_amd64 -o covermyass_linux_amd64 && \
curl -L https://github.com/sundowndev/covermyass/releases/latest/download/covermyass_SHA256SUMS -o covermyass_SHA256SUMS && \
curl -L https://github.com/sundowndev/covermyass/releases/latest/download/covermyass_SHA256SUMS.gpg -o covermyass_SHA256SUMS.gpg
```

2. Import key
```bash
gpg --keyserver https://keys.openpgp.org --recv-keys 0xE5BC23488DA8C7AC
```

3. Verify signature (optionally trust the key from gnupg to avoid any warning)
```bash
gpg --verify covermyass_SHA256SUMS.gpg covermyass_SHA256SUMS
```

4. Verify checksum
```bash
sha256sum --ignore-missing -c covermyass_SHA256SUMS
```

### Usage ###

```
$ covermyass -h

Usage:
  covermyass [flags]

Examples:

Overwrite log files as well as those found by path /db/*.log
covermyass --write -p /db/*.log

Overwrite log files 5 times with a final overwrite with zeros to hide shredding
covermyass --write -z -n 5


Flags:
  -f, --filter strings   File paths to ignore (supports glob patterns)
  -h, --help             help for covermyass
  -n, --iterations int   Overwrite N times instead of the default (default 3)
  -l, --list             Show files in a simple list format. This will prevent any write operation
      --no-read-only     Exclude read-only files in the list. Must be used with --list
  -v, --version          version for covermyass
      --write            Erase found log files. This WILL shred the files!
  -z, --zero             Add a final overwrite with zeros to hide shredding
```

First, run an analysis. This will not erase anything.

```bash
$ covermyass

Loaded known log files for linux
Scanning file system...

Found the following files
/var/log/lastlog (29.5 kB, -rw-rw-r--)
/var/log/btmp (0 B, -rw-rw----)
/var/log/wtmp (0 B, -rw-rw-r--)
/var/log/faillog (3.2 kB, -rw-r--r--)

Summary

```

When you acknowledged the results, erase those files.

```bash
$ covermyass --write -n 100

Filter out some paths : 

```bash
$ covermyass -f '/foo/**/*.log' -f '/bar/foo.log'
```
